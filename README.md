Fix setup.sh by errors.txt

Basic requirements:

- make: for windows to run make file in Lolac
- g++: to compile Lolac

# TODO:

- Confirm setup.sh and setup.cmd work on fresh windows / fresh ubuntu 
- Maybe find a way to visualise verilog compiled files
- Get page hosted with https:/ and a custom domain
